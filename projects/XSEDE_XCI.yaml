Description: >-
  The mission of the XSEDE Cyberinfrastructure Integration (XCI) 
  team is to integrate, adapt, and disseminate software tools and related 
  services across the national CI community enabling the US research 
  community to do its work better and more easily than before â€“ making it 
  easier for administrators and users of campus-based cyberinfrastructure 
  systems to make use of tools created by XSEDE for local benefit, and 
  expand upon XSEDE's effort to enable the creation of an integrated national 
  cyberinfrastructure. XCI is using OSG resources to learn how OSG tools and 
  services work, and to explore potential areas of collaborations. This 
  includes but is not limited to OSG Connect, HTCondor, CVMFS, and identity 
  and access management services.
